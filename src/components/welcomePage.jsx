            It is a small step in my path to become a Data Scientist<br/>
            <br/>
            Please click in the "Start Facial Analisis" (Web Camera is needed) link, to start running the app <br/>
            It will use your webcam for real time sentiment prediction, based in your facial expression<br/>
            Due to lack of public facial expressions databases, it is not 100% accurate<br/>
            Currently its accuracy is around 75-80%<br/>

            <li>Sad</li>
            <li>Anger</li>
            <li>Happy</li>
